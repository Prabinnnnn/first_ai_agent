# Python project implementing a simple AI agent using django and LangGraph

## üß† Overview

- Integrates **Django ORM** for data storage  
- Uses **LangGraph** to orchestrate agent workflows  
- Leverages **Permit** for fine-grained RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)  
 


Key capabilities include:

- Saving user data securely through Django  
- Executing third-party API tools and custom logic  
- Interacting with Django models via agent queries (no vector embeddings required)  
- Easily switching between different LLM providers

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Django integration** for data & user management  
- **LangGraph workflows** to coordinate agent behavior  
- **Dynamic tool execution** (e.g. fetching recent documents, querying models)  
- **Permit-powered RBAC** for secure access control  
- **Fully modular**: swap LLMs or tools as needed
